# 3. Project Title and Description
The IT Career Launch Platform is a web-based system designed to support IT students and junior specialists in gaining practical experience through real projects and guided learning.
The platform serves as a centralized environment where students can explore available projects, apply for participation, and improve their skills through courses, while mentors and employers can post projects and manage applications.

The system is supported by a relational SQL database that ensures structured data storage, data integrity, and efficient retrieval of information.

Key Features and System Processes:
- User Registration and Role Management
- Project Creation and Management
- Project Browsing and Application
- Application Status Tracking
- Course Listing for Skill Development
- Data Management and Integrity

# 4. Problem Statement
Many IT students face difficulties entering the job market due to a lack of practical experience, real projects, and professional mentorship.
Traditional education often focuses on theory, while employers require hands-on skills. As a result, students struggle to build portfolios, and companies struggle to find prepared junior specialists.

# 5. Project Objectives
The main objectives of the project are:

- To provide IT students with access to real projects and practical experience
- To connect students with mentors and employers
- To simplify the process of applying for projects
- To store and manage information about users, projects, and applications using an SQL database
- To improve students’ employability and career readiness

# 6. Scope of the System
The system includes:

- User registration and role management (student, mentor, employer)
- Project creation and management
- Project application and status tracking
- Course listing for skill development
- Data storage and management using an SQL database

System Limitations:

The system has the following limitations:
- The platform does not include online payment or financial transactions
- Real-time communication features (such as live chat or video calls) are not supported
- The system does not provide automated project matching or AI-based recommendations
- Advanced analytics and reporting features are not included
- The system is designed for academic and demonstration purposes only and may not support large-scale commercial usage

# 7. Expected Users
The platform is designed for the following users:

- Students – apply for projects, join courses, and gain experience
- Mentors – create projects and guide students
- Employers – post projects and find junior specialists
- Administrators – manage users and system data
