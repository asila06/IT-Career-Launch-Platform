The system is supported by a relational SQL database that ensures structured data storage, data integrity, and efficient retrieval of information.

Key Features and System Processes:
- User Registration and Role Management
- Project Creation and Management
- Project Browsing and Application
- Application Status Tracking
- Course Listing for Skill Development
- Data Management and Integrity

# 4. Problem Statement
- Many IT students face difficulties entering the job market due to a lack of practical experience, real projects, and professional mentorship.
Traditional education often focuses on theory, while employers require hands-on skills. As a result, students struggle to build portfolios, and companies struggle to find prepared junior specialists.

# 5. Project Objectives
- The main objectives of the project are:

To provide IT students with access to real projects and practical experience
To connect students with mentors and employers
To simplify the process of applying for projects
To store and manage information about users, projects, and applications using an SQL database
To improve students’ employability and career readiness

# 6. Scope of the System
- The system includes:

User registration and role management (student, mentor, employer)
Project creation and management
Project application and status tracking
Course listing for skill development
Data storage and management using an SQL database

System Limitations:

The system has the following limitations:
The platform does not include online payment or financial transactions
Real-time communication features (such as live chat or video calls) are not supported
The system does not provide automated project matching or AI-based recommendations
Advanced analytics and reporting features are not included
The system is designed for academic and demonstration purposes only and may not support large-scale commercial usage

# 7. Expected Users
- The platform is designed for the following users:

Students – apply for projects, join courses, and gain experience
Mentors – create projects and guide students
Employers – post projects and find junior specialists
Administrators – manage users and system data
